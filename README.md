# UsingSharedBufferWithUWP
This is a sample repository that demonstrates how to share buffers from UWP to WebView2 using [SharedBuffer](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/blob/main/specs/SharedBuffer.md).

For the demonstration, we would:
1. Create UWP app
2. Add WebView2 to render a local HTML file
3. Add a button to select image and send it to WebView2
4. Render the image recieved from native process in HTML
